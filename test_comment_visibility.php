// Simple test script to verify comment visibility logic
echo "=== Comment Visibility Test ===\n\n";

echo "Test Scenarios:\n";
echo "1. Content with visibility_scope = 'all' -> All students can see all comments\n";
echo "2. Content with visibility_scope = 'department' -> Only same department students can see comments\n";
echo "3. Content with visibility_scope = null/empty -> All students can see all comments (legacy)\n\n";

echo "Expected Behavior:\n";
echo "- BSIT student posts comment on 'all departments' content -> All students see it\n";
echo "- BSBA student posts comment on 'all departments' content -> All students see it\n";
echo "- BSIT student posts comment on 'BSIT only' content -> Only BSIT students see it\n";
echo "- BSBA student posts comment on 'BSIT only' content -> Cannot comment (no access)\n\n";

echo "Implementation Details:\n";
echo "- Comments are filtered based on content's visibility_scope\n";
echo "- If content targets 'all' departments: Show comments from all students + admins\n";
echo "- If content targets specific department: Show comments from same department + admins\n";
echo "- Admin comments are always visible regardless of targeting\n\n";

echo "Files Modified:\n";
echo "- app/Http/Controllers/CommentController.php (getComments method)\n";
echo "- Updated comment filtering logic to respect content visibility scope\n\n";

echo "Test this by:\n";
echo "1. Login as BSIT student\n";
echo "2. Comment on content published to 'All Departments'\n";
echo "3. Login as BSBA student\n";
echo "4. Check if you can see the BSIT student's comment on 'All Departments' content\n";
echo "5. Check if you cannot see BSIT student's comments on 'BSIT only' content\n";
