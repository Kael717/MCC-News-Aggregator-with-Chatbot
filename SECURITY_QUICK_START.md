```

### 2. Monitor Security Events
```bash
# View security logs
tail -f storage/logs/security.log

# View authentication logs
tail -f storage/logs/auth.log
```

### 3. Configure Security Settings
Edit `config/security.php` to customize:
- Rate limiting thresholds
- File upload restrictions
- Security headers
- Monitoring settings

### 4. Set Up Email Alerts
Configure admin emails in `config/security.php`:
```php
'monitoring' => [
    'admin_emails' => ['admin@mcc-nac.edu.ph', 'security@mcc-nac.edu.ph'],
],
```

SECURITY_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_ALERT_EMAILS=admin@mcc-nac.edu.ph,security@mcc-nac.edu.ph
```

### Rate Limiting Configuration
```php
// In config/security.php
'rate_limiting' => [
    'endpoints' => [
        'login' => ['attempts' => 5, 'decay_minutes' => 1],

    ],
],
```

## 📊 Security Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Failed Login Attempts** - Track suspicious login patterns
2. **Rate Limit Violations** - Monitor for brute force attacks
3. **Suspicious Activities** - Watch for injection attempts
4. **File Upload Attempts** - Monitor for malicious uploads
5. **Security Alerts** - Review all security events

### Log Locations
- **Security Events**: `storage/logs/security.log`
- **Authentication**: `storage/logs/auth.log`
- **Application**: `storage/logs/laravel.log`

## 🚨 Incident Response

### When Security Alerts Trigger
1. **Check the alert email** for details
2. **Review security logs** for context
3. **Check IP blacklist** if needed
4. **Take appropriate action** based on severity
5. **Document the incident** for future reference

### Common Security Events
- **Multiple failed logins** - May indicate brute force attack
- **Suspicious patterns** - Potential injection attempts
- **Rate limit violations** - Automated attack detection
- **Invalid file uploads** - Malicious file upload attempts
