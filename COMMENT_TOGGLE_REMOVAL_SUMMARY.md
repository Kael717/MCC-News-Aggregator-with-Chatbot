# Comment Toggle Removal Summary

## Changes Made
Successfully removed the on/off toggle for the comment section so that comments are always displayed when users open any content container.

## Specific Changes

### 1. Removed Toggle UI Elements
- **Removed**: Toggle switch and "ON/OFF" labels
- **Removed**: Toggle container with switch styling
- **Simplified**: Comments section header to just show "Comments" with count

### 2. Updated JavaScript State Management
- **Changed**: `showComments: false` to `showComments: true`
- **Removed**: `toggleComments()` function
- **Added**: `init()` function with watcher to auto-load comments when modal opens

### 3. Auto-Load Comments
- **Added**: Automatic comment loading when any content modal opens
- **Added**: `$watch('activeModal')` to detect when new content is opened
- **Ensured**: Comments load immediately without user interaction

### 4. Cleaned Up Modal Events
- **Removed**: All `showComments = false` references from modal close events
- **Simplified**: Modal close events to only clear comment state
- **Maintained**: Comment state clearing when switching between content

## How It Works Now

### Before (With Toggle):
1. User opens content modal
2. User must manually toggle "Comments" switch to ON
3. Comments load after toggle
4. User can toggle OFF to hide comments

### After (Always Visible):
1. User opens content modal
2. Comments automatically load and display
3. No toggle needed - comments are always visible
4. Comments are isolated to each content item

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: No extra step needed to view comments
2. **Immediate Access**: Comments are visible as soon as content opens
3. **Simplified Interface**: Cleaner UI without toggle controls
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Comments always available for all content

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes:
```javascript
// Before
showComments: false,
toggleComments() { ... }

// After  
showComments: true,
init() {
    this.$watch('activeModal', (newModal) => {
        if (newModal) {
            this.loadComments();
        }
    });
}
```

### UI Changes:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<div class="flex items-center space-x-3">
    <div class="flex items-center">
        <span class="text-sm text-gray-600 mr-2">Comments</span>
        <label class="relative inline-flex items-center cursor-pointer">
            <input type="checkbox" x-model="showComments" @change="toggleComments()" class="sr-only peer">
            <!-- Toggle switch styling -->
        </label>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- After -->
<!-- Toggle completely removed, comments always visible -->
```

## Result
- ✅ Comments are now always visible when opening any content container
- ✅ No toggle switch needed
- ✅ Comments automatically load when content opens
- ✅ Each content item still has its own isolated comment thread
- ✅ Cleaner, more intuitive user interface
